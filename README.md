*Bundled:* [Idain's](https://github.com/Idain) [Custom Dex Colors](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Customizable-Pok%C3%A9dex-Color) and [Toggle Shiny Palettes](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Option-to-show-shiny-colors-in-Pok%C3%A9dex)

*REQUIRED:* (bug/design flaw fix about Radio Tower)
- [Unique Mon Icons](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Add-a-new-party-menu-icon)

- Naryu's Gen3 Type/Status/Cat Tiles. Pokedex portion must be implemented. Other parts, optional.

FEATURES:  Base stats and info, Move Info, Detailed area info, Evolution chart, and sprite page showing animated sprites (reflects shiny toggle too).

Move Information: Lvl-Up Moves -> Field Moves (plus lvl learned and/or TM/HM/Move Tutor) -> Egg Moves -> TMs.

AREA Pages: Currently supports Johto/Kanto Walking/grass/surfing encounters plus their swarms. Fishing Rods information is also included. Right now, all it will show you is the relevant Fishing Group Name. To check your local Fishing Group, check the PokeGear.

POKEGEAR: Now shows the detailed name of map you're currently in (based on Map Group & Map Number) and it also reads the map's attribute to see it's fishing group, if it has one.

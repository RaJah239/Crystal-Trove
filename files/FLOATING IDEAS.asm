Bugs:
- Check bike music everywhere to ensure it doesn’t cut off anywhere except national park
- Still taking steps after opening text boxes if the “step cycle” is wasn’t completed. (60 fps bug)
- Turning in an encounter location prompt an encounter without turning the player. (60 fps bug)
- Enter the battle tower and check your PC box, the first top left Mon blinks every few frames. Checking stats or resetting game fixes it. 
- Autofire A next to water when trying to Surf can cause the player to immediately exit. (Very rare though)
- Route next to olivine has a kid that appears as soon as entering, just need to move him. 
- If a pokemon is traded and it’s above the level cap when deposited in the daycare then withdrawn, the daycare person will say hey be gone up more than 100 levels and ask for a glitched amount of money but it’s not much but then the pokemon will be set at the level cap. This causes no issue. 
- Lucky Number show doesn't work right

Here:
Added Giovanni, Proton, Petrel, Agatha, Lorelei, Maxima, Scarlet, Ariana, Archer and Eusine's over-world sprites.

Consider Mons:
10 encounters per area? 9x 11% and 1x 1%? Includes surf/water too?

Total: 11
Swablu (1) evolves Lv 30(?)
Ralts entire line (4)
Makuhita (buffed stats for higher level evo) & Hariyama (2) (buffed defense + special defense equally to hit 505 BST)
Baltoy + Claydol (2)
Zigzagzoon’s final stage (1)

Neutral:
Luvdisc - Pure Water (replace Mantine) fast frail special attacker (HP: 55 Atk: 60 Def: 50 SpA: 110 SpD: 60 Speed: 130 - 465 BST) + Heart Scale Loot
Not Pysmoth but Dustox (bulky special attacker - Bug/Poison)
Replace Rat line with Zigzagoon Dark/Normal 3 stage line with it. 

Remove: 13
Regis (4)
Shiftry (1)
A.Exeggutor
Spiritomb (1)
A.Ninetales (1)
Roselia & Roserade (2)
Missingno
Mr.Mime

Edits:
Pidgeot to get Staraptor evolve level + stats
Gastly line as Ghost/Dark
Starmie Water/Fairy
Altaria - Dragon/Fairy (Latias like stats 540 BST), learns heal bell, recover etc. 

Moves:
Fake out (check how to add more priorities from Ferroplexa) to get +4 for Protect and +3 for Fake Out
Focus Blast 120 Fighting, Special, 70% Acc, 10% SpecDef drop & 8 PP + a TM
Make Surf physical since Scald would usually be preferable?
Beetle Bash: Priority, 40 Atk, Bug. Quick attack disappear + tackle then reappear
(Keep all Priority moves 40 Power)
MegaHorn: 100 Power, 95% Accuracy
Outrage to 100 Power, Clair’s TM, Recoil

BST:
Make legends 600 BST and Keep Pseudos 600 BST (since they have 4x weaknesses) this includes Dragonite, Tyranitar, Garchomp, etc 


Minimal Dialogue Mode Ideas:
Remove Exp gain from both regular and Exp Share
Remove stat changes (buffs, debuffs)
Skip giving money text and mom’s money text after battles 


Other:
Recalculate stats after battle via Polished Crystal commit 

A full training kit would be 26 of each vitamin, of each of the 6 stats would cost:
$1,528,800 not including 50 Rare Candy which is 240,000 so total would be:
$1,768,800. Make the Goldenrod roof bargain sell all vitamins at selling price ($4900 instead of $9800) so the deal above is about the same price so with that bargain factored in as the cost of all 156 vitamins + 50 rare candies is $1,004,400 which is a great deal as Rare Candies can’t be purchased!

Egg Tutor code to point to EvoAttackPointers to make Move Encyclopedia! May have to reorder move names so it’ll be in alphabetical order?


Have a fortune teller in each town that when pay a fee checks your events and slyly tells you what to do next?

Hydreigan side quests: make a new beasts check to check if captured all dark mons and have a map call back or event that gets sets to have Hydreigan appear deep in dark cave or a cave opens up where he’s located, this would be better so his event can easily be cleared on beating Red. Mapcall back, beast check, iftrue earthquake like Rock Smash, Strength sound and a message stating: “A sound of rocks moving/crumbling nearby. A path may have cleared up” which have.

keep printer for unowns, relabel it to just display all, add the final unown that should be in the vacant spot

Add Snorlax deep in Dark Cave where its large sprite sleeps. Post game gets exp card to use pokeflute channel to wake it up. 

Kimono girls are in the middle of their rehearsal so they can't be bothered with until Morty is beaten? When you do enter, you get a scene of them dancing as they finish up?

Draw a graphic arrow on Trainer Card to go left to view Badges like Crystal Ultimate

Remove all unused tiles

…
…

I don’t have time for this!”

E4 and Lance first and second matches have 2 teams each random?

Planning to drop nidoran-f to free up a space in my dex. The plan would be to allow nidoran-m to be male and female, then evolve based on gender. If I change nidoran-m's gender ratio in `data/pokemon/base_stats` is that enough?
Key Item escape rope?

EV trainers that rebattle (when Clair is beaten to prepare for Giovanni and end game) in each route, like route 29 - HP, route xx - Attack

Prevent trading until end game/last level cap to prevent the bug with the day care?

remove unused sprites from Kanto like diglet from cerulean police station etc
remove unused variable sprites from fuchsia

NPC Route 29/30/31? “Careful, the moves Bug Bite and Peck can steal held items if none are equipped”.

Digletts dug the slow poke well

Have the route 29 tree NPC say that on evenings you can encounter pokemon from the day and night 

Check polished how headbutt and surf and more field moves don’t ask the player to use it again in the same area like headbutt immediately works when interacting with a tree or surf too

Make a note in my docs to check grateoracle AI scoring and switch for ideas to use like his U-turn, Teleport, Baton Pass

Togepi around day care at 1% has lucky eggs common and Miracle Berry/Everstone rare ? Available as a swarm

End game bug catching contest, check flag, top tier bugs. Lv 2-50 bugs. Participation prize is a sunstone, 1st place: Master Ball, 2nd Place: 11 Crystal, 3rd: 4x Sacred Ash

For Berry Trees:
src/renewable_hidden_items.c is where all the code related to that is defined
so from my quick look at that file
there is a secret step counter that counts up
and every 1500 steps there is random chance rolled to renew the hidden items
hidden items are characterized into 3 different groups
common, uncommon and  rare
after 1500 steps they have 60%, 30% and 10% chance to renew the item respectively

So give all berry trees a step counter, same with mushrooms 

Check SourCrystal for swarms appearing on pokegear

Try Unown in day care to view their icon and hatch their eggs 

Make side quests for caught time, Hidden Power and Effort Values to appear on 4th stat page

Add new map landmark and name for Dark Cave Blackthorn side

Remove Pokemon centre fast heal?

Download Nayru’s guide on status tiles

Make a physical hidden power too!!! Name it “Hidden Force” (Add TM too!) + name it “Hidden Type/Inner Attribute” on 4th stat page + it’s animation:

It does the same Hidden Power start up animation with the orbs floating around and then a hit animation like “tackle” so it’ll fit all pokemon

GoldenrodCityPanUpScript:  for the radio tower, battle tower and anyt thing else

Grate Oracle message on the accuracy being —- on moves 

Top floor has maxima alone mainly because he’ll have some maybe a lot of nicknames pokemon 

Remove scientists from Rock battle animation as it does so in the battle tower or make a new trainer class and give it to that use the same sprite as scientists but still remove the battle transition from scientists so it won’t affect the battle tower.

The Gym Guide will tell you that Gym Leaders and certain boss trainers will not consume held items in battle












Crystal Trove:


Important!!!

There are 208 trainer constants in my game atm
If I gave them all 6 pokemon fully customised (individual nickname, DVs, EVs, Items, Moves) that would require 30784 byes or 1.5% of the rom space.

Each trainer with 6 pokemon would need 148 bytes of data.
ROM - 2097152 bytes

Check out twitch plays anniversary crystal romhack the ending is supposed to be interesting or find videos

General TODO
Complete Unown dex to see Hidden Power type on 4 status page 
Also, to unlock Nown battle to capture

When the swarm system is added to the TV ensure it says that swarms usually end at 12:00am

Map call back shadow, rustling grass, water movement or dust cloud in caves for random pokemon like the grottos I originally wanted. 





Elms post league phone call tells the player that the battle resort is open to you. Have a book or something in the player’s room that tells of the post game stuff like infinitely recatchable legendaries, Snorlax, Sudowoodo etc. each person in the resort has a side quest before battling. 

Upon entering the Gym lounge, the gym guide is there has a scene and tells you about the place. Has a porygon PC and chansey on each floor and each person here you need to do a quest to be allowed to fight them. More people you unlocked, the more that will appear, so first floor is Johto leader, second is Kanto, third is Agatha, Lorelei, Blue and Red

Giovanni is in Tojo falls post Blue beating he appears. Have a hint about him. 

Side quests to unlock trainers, everyone except Blue unlocks round 2 pokemon league, that unlocks Blue, Blue unlocks Red. Blue, Red, Agatha and Lorelei are on the top most floor. After everyone gets unlocked, they battle on certain days. Agatha and Lorelei are unlocked when all gym leaders are beaten except Blue. They both unlock Round 2 pokemon league, that unlocks blue and blue unlocks Red. Everyone battles on specific days after. Red unlocks Mt Silver to claim MewTwo

Red has a random team each battle?

Expand maps in general, add more map objects. Give a reason to always revisit maps post game 

Team Rocket at Lake of Rage is using device to control pokemon, force them to evolve too to make them money makers

Radio Tower take over to control pokemon world wide!

Rewrite Team Rocket scripts and have Giovanni be the final boss in the radio tower? Radio tower take over is post Gym 8. Has Mewtwo as a single pokemon (says it was created from the progenitor of all pokemon in a lab far away) and MewTwo releases itself after. 

MewTwo is in…Mt Silver above barn/farm. It’s caved in (changeblock) until you become champion

Check TM locations in vanilla and determine where to put them nkw 

Elm’s lab is normal but have Oak’s lab in the battle resort and have him say that he used to be a serious trainer when he was young and they wanted him here for his expertise but continues his research as well here. Replace references to him saying he is from Kanto

Violet City:
A new haunted house in violet city and a woman says that she feels chills at night as a map callback post morty? or someone else. Come back at night and she’ll says it’s chilly right now. Each day speaking to a spot in there give an encounter or duskull

Slowpoke well connects to Union Cave. 

Ilex Forest
Snorlax here (maybe post game)

Goldenrod
Replace Train Station
Mart sells stones for $10,000 and don’t get from a rocks
Florine gives a berry each day. Post x badge, give all berries including Gold and Miracle
Bills grandpa is there and gives a stone for every pokemon you show him that he wanted to see until he gives all Evo stones and then once a day he gives a stone 


Ecruteak:
The cemetery or pokemon tower is in Ecruteak at the back like the shrine in Polished Crystal’s back. Optional and has trainers. No ghosts in burned tower or bell sprout tower but in Ecruteak’s cemetery and Curse TM is at the top

Kimono girls have starters second stages of all starter pokemon? or something unique so?

Have Eusine in the Suicune Tin Tower event after the battle he should tell you he’ll head home. Here he does the beast check and gives the Rainbow Wing if you catch all dogs
Eusine’s house in Ecruteak


Mt. Mortar
Clefairy dance spot above Mt Mortar
Zapdos appears after collecting 8 Badge deep inside past the waterfall

Route 38 berry farm

Battle Resort:
Gym Leader/Important Character house
Beat everyone (set event everyone) for Blue to appear, beat Blue for Red to appear
Oaks lab downstairs, research on a new way of battling (inverse battles side quest)

Inverse battle building locked (old trainer house) until the oak’s inverse battle side quest is over. It has a sign on the door “Renovations ongoing” or put it in the sign 

Battle Tower Mart
The clerk there, trades coins for TMs. Is the Battle Tower endorsing gambling?
Battle Tower gives 3 Crystals and a trainer like a gym leader or RED gives 1 Crystal and no money 

In oaks lab, getting the shiny charm has a book appear in the day care that tells the player that it does affect eggs but a a shiny ditto or parent (which ever is right, make or female) will give the egg a 3% chance to be shiny 

Cianwood City:
SS Aqua ticket gotten here to travel back faster

Ice Path:
Articuno


Prior to victory road is the badge checks from RBY

Victory Road:
Moltres

“The team got EXP”
from EXP. SHARE.”

Daily shadows on the ow for flying pokemon encounters check Mae Orange for my ideas 


The northern range is cold these days 

“There are ice pikemon there now. Did they come because it got cold or they came and made it cold? Hmmm..”


Encounter percentages per slot. 7 slots: 16%, 17%, 16%, 17%, 16%, 17%, 1%
BW3G-Items for items like expert belt and such and move effects (start from the initial commit and move up)
Even Improve the Hidden Grotto Item system commit and hidden grotto items
Replace cleanse tag item
252 EVs to show “MAX” instead or a star or 3 stars
Verify the HEDGER can cut grass when it’s added
Rematch trainers to always play their encounter music on each rematch
Remove text scroll speed from Options, replace it with “Skateboard: On/Off”. Check Running Shoes tutorial & polished Crystal Options Menu asm file  
```object_event x, y, sprite, movement, rx, ry, h1, h2, palette, type, range, script, event_flag ```
That's not super clear 😛 In this case, h stands for hour. You can define a range of hours of the day during which the object appears. It won't show up outside those hours.
Look at the battle tower code for receiving more than one item and use it in elms lab for getting 5x Pokeballs. Maybe consider using this more when finding more than 1 item in the ow? Maybe make a std script for it?
In rock smash rocks, add appropriate mons
Use the monster sprite for all Grotto encounters but with the appropriate palette to save sprite spots first
Pay for pokemon at the battle tower back with money or crystals, use a scrolling menu too like the TMs if possible
Grate Crystal Noctowl Sprite:
It's from the Spaceworld leaks, which showed a bunch of beta designs from gen 2. That's what Noctowl looked like at earlier stages of development. I think we can all agree they should've kept it.
Edit pokegear moon to be more visible, check day and morn icons too
Make Gyarados to Physically orientated Water/Dragon with 540 BST Haxorous stats. Kingdra more specially orientated with 540 BST Haxoorus reshuffled stats!





Have a Pokédex/book on top of Elm’s pokeball table post Red that gives the phone call message from Elm

Bug: pokeball that catches the pokemon does not get used up, fix this, this is caused by one of the 4 “Charms” commits recently.. Probably shiny is my current guess
Make the catch charm, exp charm and shiny charm hold items? Not sure since they can be lost easier - remove Catch Charm, that has the bug

In Pokédex remove old mode and only keep regular mode + A-Z mode 

Move trade back kid to Mahogany to prevent OP evolution pokemon being used early 

Maybe have the scientist give a random ancient pokemon? Idk yet, maybe now.

Have grottos use generic ow sprites like vanilla party icons example he oddish to represent grass mons, the monster sprite for 4 legged mons, bird sprite for all birds,  etc. use different ow palettes to differentiate 

Port PumPum display type in battle 

Give an event for all gym leaders in their gyms, Check event best Red, have them disappear on certain days and have them appear in a gym leader rematch house like grate Crystal ? Give an event after the first battle so the text will be shorter on each subsequent battle. Can lose, no money, give Crystal for winning. Also, use the same checkevtn Red in gyms to have the leaders give a different quote like “up for a rematch? Can’t be today, let meet in the gym leader lounge on Xxxday of the week”. Have the gym guide at he lounge too. Have neat interactions between gym leaders? Like Bugsy and Misty? Move victor here. Have Brock be next to Jasmine. He says he and Jasmine has a lot in common. Have Agatha and Lorelei in the ow, and after beating them and after event beat RED, have them appear here..?Lt Surge and Chuch has things in common since they’ve both trained a lot. Whitney and Erika are friends, some can stand alone by themselves

Check how the poke gear pulls the “Day” and add that to the Menu Clock and add it to the tutorial

Victor only allows his service post Red. He says he’s still setting up but check back in a while. Then check event Red to give the right script 

Make shiny charm give extra 2 rolls so it’ll be 2/255 or 1% chance to find a shiny. Eggs are still the best to get a shiny with a shiny ditto, being 1/32 or 3.25%

End game bug catching contest to add post Red and have the phone call talk about it. 

Out Silver Cave Outside in its own section to make that map script as large as possible 

Check for text that get used more than once and textfar them like the trees text

Battle tower has a blocker and says that it’s only open to trainers that have proven themselves and have at least 8 badge or 7? 

Add different game corner prize pokemon on different days to make shiny hunting easier and reduce the number of ow sprites used for pokemon and grotto maps (for space)

Make wild and trainer Pokémon display an icon to show if it is holding an item Near the pokeball icon

Make pp not restore when deposit in boxes:
From Grate:
“There's a function that restores deposited PP. Don't remember the exact name. You can get rid of it. It's meant to balance the portable PC.”

Remove the code for trading to gen1 and remove and make smaller pokecentre F2

Use “waitsfx” when lance gives trophies and check if it saves space. 

Buena’s prize to update after certain points or just post Red or post pokedex? Grate has catch charm and hardhat here for example

Remove Lucky number show and give a random item daily

Add Hydreigon - Dark/Dragon + Float. Make a quest for it. 

Rework tree system since I now know how to add more daily flags. Edit each map file to use more textfar like in the bgevent for when the fruit is not on the tree to save more space.

Add delete save data to continue screen

Check grate crystal and auto battle prompts immediately when starting a trainer battle for them to immediately send out there pokemon. When exp is gained to immediately and next even for multiple pokemon

If rival trainer class can’t be gotten to appear, add a new class for his battles

Nayru checks for 251 pokemon, change all the 252 to it and update accordingly
Have Nayru say that she didn’t improve the PC system but made this for it “Pocket PC” and hands you it upon first meeting? I don’t know or have Oak give it Or bill?

Add moves to the PC like how it was done in battles, then remove moves from the 3rd stat page and but the held item somewhere else? Think about this second part and try then decide 

Check if Cerulean gym machine part’s vanilla item event is unused 
Keep max wild pokemon to be leve 63


Have Kurt’s daughter slowpoke grow back it’s tail after some event, mapcallback, and have an event to have her tell you that it grew back and then she gives a random apricorn daily 

Have meganium evolve by sun stone as a added boost to it

Revert randomise trainer teams? Idk..seems not so useful now..

When entering Union cave grotto, in that scene script have all Pokémon disappear and verify if this works. 

On my Pokédex using BGB emulator, make it a certain size, cut out all the types as pngs to he used in google sheets

Move tutor Power Gem?

Battle tower blocker says he isn’t allowed to let anyone that has less than 8 badges to enter?

Verify how the 4 stat page and pokeseer works on vanilla Nayru’s dex and if it works well, revert her level capture fix and remove it from the 4th stat page and edit the trade/hatch text as necessary?

Mary interview, neat idea, even beat R: Implement Mary's interview; lay basis for future interviews · shasocastris/crystal_castris@9066fe0
Also make a Red2 defeat flag that when set, Mary gives random 2: 1x Master Ball, 4x Sacred Ash or 33x Crystal. After receiving the item, she clears the flag for next time Red is beaten 

To save Event slots, change all grotto Pokémon to Event_Grotto_Mon_1, Event_Grotto_Mon_2, Event_Grotto_Mon_3, Event_Grotto_Mon_4 and Event_Grotto_Mon_5 at the bottom of the file and verify it works with that spot and all spots properly with appearing and disappearing of Pokémon 

Buying pokemon with special moves with crystals and money? Or scared ashes

Maybe add an extra 31 x 4 Evs to each stat to make it like Later gens since right now Pokémon have 0 DVs essentially?

Add special areas for grotto Pokémon in the dex Like how Ho-oh and other Pokémon were done. Have scarlet in union cave say that your Pokédex even have a special page for grotto Pokémon and certain special Pokémon.  

Don’t forget about rainbow metal pidgeons Extreme Crystal project on GitHub Incase he adds more replability to the battle tower or more areas. 

Double check everywhere I added “can lose’ battles like maxima, rival2, Cal’s remplacement if “heal party is needed” and remove them accordingly

Trainer card star system, check mauvesea hack or search “charm” on pret to find her GitHub

https://github.com/TimKun55/pokecrystal/commit/c6364bc647f11629945812437ad01411b6ce8a1c

Make levels ranging from 2-max level of each grass patch?
Have 10 encounters per grass/water tile. 11% for 9 and 1% for 1. So 99% common encounters and 1% rare.
Do levels 2-max for bug catching contest too
Check a site to calculate the players bug catching contest score and use that to edit the NPCs potential scores then test. 

Get quick claw to play the berry animation when it activates.

Remove map filler bytes

Exp Charm, Catching Charm made - needs to be given to a route leader

Items to make:
Remove bitter items, as Frustration will be removed in game and the soda pops + other vending machine drinks..useless items really

Focus Sash, eviolite, muscle band, wise glasses, Black Sludge gives ⅛ hp each turn to poison types, Heat Rock, Smooth Rock, Damp Rock, maybe try back Life Orb and have it take ⅛ HP? Maybe add a sweet scent item? Ensure it works with select or else don’t add it - give to a route leader. Muscle band and Wis glasses to give 1.1 instead of 1.15 modifier Gen 4 sitrus berry from sour crystal

Eviolite + Everstone in one - description - prevents evolution, ups defenses (hold), check grate crystal’s description for everstone


Flanker after battle text should be something like “swoop in anytime!”

Make all gym leaders, phone trainers rematches at lv 100 Can lose battles end game except E4 and have elm’s phone call indicate that


Put the list here:
Falkner

Another gym guide scene he tells you it’s been an honour to follow your journey and he challenges you to a battle and then wishes you the best! He disappears after unlocking Mt. Silver and appears in the pokemon league there after wishing you the best again..?
Fix sprites in the house with spearow and raticate
Pokegear pokecentre
Gym guide fights the player before Blue, check Crystal Ultimate






Pallet Town
Put Nayru in oaks lab. She gives the shiny charm after completing the dex. Have oaks rating tell you to talk to Nayru in his lab and there is a building in celadon you should visit. Give her Loreilie’s sprite Blue in ow palette
Have talking to oak play his music before and after the battle if it doesn’t already. His music is in Mr. Pokemon’s house
Oak’s lab Aides have the same dialogue to change
Green fat guy that talks about trading pokemon across time..edit text



Nurses and clerks make colour-coded based on the city's name

Cinnabar / seafoam islands
Edit sea foam islands to make it look closed up. Look at Gen1 map. Have someone in the water say that Lava fell on it..destroying it and sealed up the entrance. Articuno and all the Pokémon in it  fled and seeked shelter elsewhere
Check out cinnabar island in sour crystal island and maybe take some stuff from it or make up my own after taking a good look at it.

Some Animations:

Make flash flash cannon like grate oracle check his stuff

Dazzling Gleam and Pursuit Animations from Grate Crystal

The force - 15 PP, 100% Acc, 80 Damage, psychic/ physical. Power gem animation from here. Hyper fang effect and animation from here too. Items like Catch Charm, Hard hat etc I'm thinking of adding a sidequest with inverse battles that unlocks the ability to play the Battle Tower in inverse mode. Haven't added that yet though.

Freeze dry, add a new type and have it’s name be ICE too, save type effectiveness as ICE but also super effective on water
Special, 70 power, 100 accuracy, 32 PP, 10% to freeze
Freeze-Dry deals damage and has a 10% change of freezing the target. In addition to Ice's usual type advantages, Freeze-Dry is also super-effective against the Water type. This in effect gives the move its own (slightly different) type chart, as shown below:

End Stuff

Pokemon to swap out
Port sour apple’s sprites and animations
Do something else for Dipolma printing and unown printing since they have been removed
Add entire music ost to radio?

Ninetales - Fire/Ghost + Levitates + Dark Void move at 80% Sleep Accuracy, sleeps 3 turns max.
Togetic - Fairy type alone  that levitates?
Remove Slugma line - add solrock - fire/rock that floats, solrock day, lunatone night
Add Jirachi? It’s pshycic/steel and it floats
Add Lunatone - rock/psychic
Replace Togetic with Togekiss from Polished?
Exeggutor - grass dragon - seed bomb, physical grass move, 120 attack 85 acc + 10% Burn?
Replace electrode with his variant from polished crystal 
Remove ursaring line since Kangaskhan has the same role // or replace Kangaskhan 
Make slowbro physical and slow king special water/psychic? I don’t know yet since there’s golduck
Clefairy line - Fairy/Steel typing?
Porygon2 - Normal/Electric typing and give all its individual stats as square numbers?
Make or add a steel electric Pokémon that floats? Preferably a defensive Pokémon? With bulky stats 

Add an actual bulky water type or make slow/bro/king it?

You know I was thinking.. since I’ve added that ability to have Pokémon floating..would this sound balanced:

firstly, replace the pikachu sprite with the “balloon pikachu” you know the variant that floats, also give it Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu’s stats and have Light Ball double Special Attack. Or make Red2 have that and only have the encounterable in the Cerulean Cave post Red




Write special text for special stationary encounters in the pokedex

Add all moves and then add all evolution moves + evo attacks.asm, double check the tutorial as needed - 

From the tutorial:
We've also revised the learnsets somewhat, in order to guarantee two properties:

One, evolution moves should not also be learned at level-up. Otherwise, you could be prompted to learn the move twice if you stop learning it the first time. (We do need to allow learning evolution moves and level-up moves separately, since, for example, Abra can evolve into Kadabra at level 16, learn Kinesis by evolution, and learn Confusion by level-up.)

Two, evolution moves should still appear in learnsets, in roughly the same order as before. This is so that wild Pokémon and enemy trainers' Pokémon with default movesets will still know those moves.
My solution here is usually to learn moves one level earlier. For example, if Rattata evolves into Raticate at level 20 and Raticate's evolution move is Scary Face, Raticate should learn Scary Face at level 19 instead of level 20.

Go through berries and apricorns, have an equal number of each throughout the game

Optimize move descriptions 
Ex. Tackle/Cut/Drill Peck etc. "Normal attack. No added effect."

Optimize animations 
Max out the PP on all moves.
Make each Pokémon’s Ev distribution based on their stats. Higher stat, gives more EVs in that stat:


Stats and Ev Distribution:
<45 = 0 EVs 
45+ = 1 EV
90+ = 2 EVs
120+ = 3 EVs

So Mew would give 2 in HP/Atk/Def/SpA/SpD/Spe after each KO

But Snorlax would give:
3 HP/ 2Atk/ 1 Def/ 1 SpA/ 2 SpD / 0 Spe after each KO

Add a debug red to room to test stuff + can lose  + chansey + porygon pc


Contact naryr about the pokedex select on shiny bug and how to get pokemon on pokeballs graphic
Remove print support for the diploma and mail and all references to it. 
Remove all generic calls and keep only unique trainer calls (like Jack who tells you info like Sunny Day + Solarbeam) + battles + item gifts + Improve their battles and have them get new battles where it makes sense + arrange them to be easier to reach. 
Edit fish/rod groups, surf routes and edit their levels. Have all johto encounters lower level so the trainers will be stronger and will require more effort to train up a newly caught pokemon
Colour code nurse and mart vendors to the town/city
Press b to go to the run option in wild battles
And item that calls a display of teh type chart..probably similar to the map
Remove mystery gift and print from game


Make only Maxima have random teams..as the limit seems to be 20..only really need one or two..and ensure it works!

Do a work around to get the egg tutor to play the sound effect only after learning a move..using some checks and yes or not etc.use events so she only gives her intro once
Use timkun’s 
Fix hatched eggs saying unknown location met in trade in teh 4th stat page
Make a space on the battle screen so the “lv” won’t be blocked out at level 100

Consider removing teh egg laying in the game..? Since the egg tutor can just be used to bring out the latent potential/moves of pokemon? Consider it..would have to change Elm’s intro..


Make wild surf routes have the same level Pokémon as the local area so it’d be easier to catch un evolved Pokémon like tentacool, chincou, goldeen and horsea etc. 
Add Fairy Type
Add sleep clause, compare stat to sleep in the entire team and then not allow sleep inducing moves or sleep last 3 turns..

Adjust rooftop sales : C:\cygwin64\home\My Computer\CT\data\items\rooftop_sale.asm

Take sour crystal link trade animation 
remove "add_special TrainerHouse"??? Ask grate oracle about it

Do you mean like in the end game, there is a version 2 bug catching contest? That gives a lot of crystals for first place, less for second adn 1 for third place

Trashcan puzzle in Vermilion Gym · pret/pokecrystal Wiki (github.com) the graphic wasn’t working last time

Allow map tiles to appear above sprites (so NPCs can walk behind tiles) with PRIORITY colors · pret/pokecrystal Wiki (github.com) since this wastes like 0.20% romspace

Add double super effective and double resists text like Yellow Extreme or wait for it to be added to Extreme Crystal
Reduce “call delay” where possible
Do thorough testing on nayru’s dex like how pikachu’s area glitches it out, try everything for every pokemon

Remove unused special from specialpointers.asm like what was done for the PhotoStudio code
There’s mobile code here.
Delete mobile data in the game to do more things after with that extra space

I have a “;here in CSE” comment in core.asm. Compare from here to CSE for optimisations
